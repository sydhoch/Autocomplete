# Autocomplete
simulates the autocomplete function on web browsers and texting features.

This project contains 3 versions of autocomplete: brute force, binary search, and trie autocomplete. Most of the code was given to me. My job was to:
	1 - complete the class "Term" which encapsulates a word/term and a weight pare, and allows comparisons by word as the default. 
	2 - complete the class "BinarySearchAutocomplete"- make the brute force autocomplete more efficient by using binary search instead
	3 - complete "TrieAutcomplete" using Tries and the Node class.
